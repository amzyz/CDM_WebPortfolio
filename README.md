# CDM_WebPortfolio
I want to highlight my various coding projects and graphic designs to show prospective employers and colleagues. I imagine employers and managers to be the siteâ€™s primary audience, and I imagine they encounter the site through googling my name or finding it through Linkedin, as I plan to attach it to my Linkedin profile. I would definitely want to expand on it past its submission for class, as it is a live website documenting my personal and professional development. I want to convey that I am a person with interdisciplinary skills and interests that are reflected in my areas of study- Computer Science, Information Science, and Digital Narrative and Interactive Design. Particularly, I want to convey that I am well-versed in problem solving and coding, business-oriented digital solutions, creative user experience and interfacing, and design thinking. I think a gorgeously designed website that is pleasing to the eye, shows my projects in an organized manner, and which contains content that shows I like combining art and technology would help me to achieve my rhetorical goals.
